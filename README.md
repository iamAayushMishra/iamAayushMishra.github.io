Welcome to my personal [portfolio website!](iamaayushmishra.github.io) This website serves as a showcase of my programming skills and projects. My name is Aayush Mishra, and I am a high school programmer with a passion for coding and building innovative projects.

## About Me

I am a high school student currently studying in K.V.S. My interest in programming started in middle school when I took a computer science course. Since then, I have been teaching myself programming languages and building projects in my free time.

### Projects

On my website, you can find a collection of my programming projects. 

## Technologies Used

My portfolio website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Bootstrap to create a responsive design and GitHub Pages to host the website.

## That's all for now :D


Thank you for visiting my website!
